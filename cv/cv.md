Software Engineer
# J2EE Platform NMS Product Team
## Designed and developed components of a distributed multi-tier Network Management System with additional service provisioning features. System developed utilizing newly published J2EE/Java XML standards and libraries. 
## All Components developed where implemented as Enterprise Java Beans and interacted with Java Servlets and JSP Pages. Deployment targeted the JBoss Application Server.  
# Embedded Software Development Projects:
## Developed system level processes to implement core features for Access-Network Gigabit Ethernet Switches, including FTP File Transfer, RADIUS Client, Automated 64-bit billing collector, VLAN Management, Port Priority (802.1p), and others. This was done in the C Programming Language to run on the OSE Embedded Operating System using the associated tools and APIs for that platform. Hardware Platform was 855 and 860 Motorola PowerPC processors with various IEEE 802.3 MAC Switching Cores, including several custom cores. 
# Embedded SNMP Developer:
## Designed and Developed SNMP MIBs to facilitate the exposure of product features through the SNMP Stack running on the target system. This work was done in the ASN.1 MIB Syntax defined in RFC 1066 and tools provided by MG-Soft.
## Implemented Application level APIs and SNMP Agent logic. This was done in the C Programming Language using tools from SNMP Research and MG-Soft.
# Java SNMP EMS Applet Project
## Developed a GUI Element Management System (EMS). The Application UI was developed with the Java AWT UI framework (product predated the release of Swing) and communicated with host hardware through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The EMS executed as a Web Accessible Applet and was written in the Java Programming Language using the Net-Beans IDE. Also created Perl Scripts to auto-generate Java code from SNMP ASN.1 MIB Syntax.
## Conceptualized and Proposed extension to the code generation scripts to include User Interface code as well. This design called for an XML declarative tag-set that would sit beside and extend the ASN.1 MIB syntax. The ASN.1 and XML document together would generate a completed, compile-able set of Java code representing the EMS product in its entirety.


1999 – 2000	                        Webiness, Inc.	               Spokane, WA
Web Developer
# Designed and Developed dynamic, ASP based web front-ends using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the development process, I worked directly with the client in order to set their expectations and ensure satisfaction.
# Designed and Developed ASP/MS Access based backend systems. Allowing for dynamic creation of content on the front-end. This was done using a combination of MS Access, SQL Server, and ASP 3.0 executing on the Microsoft IIS Platform.
# Administered both Linux and Windows NT server systems.
